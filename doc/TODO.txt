TODO for V Shell Nagios User interface

BUGS

MODEL/DATA

- support for mklivestatus and ndoutils broker modules, build into NagiosData class 
- integration for PNP and Nagiosgraph -> Link icons for hosts/services that lead to their respective performance graphs 


CONTROLLER

-create filter function based on monitoring features from Tactical Overview 
- update xml viewer for all pages and insert links into pages  
##There is an xml builder built into the V-Shell, although it's not fully implemented yet.  If you pass the arguments index.php?xml=hosts you'll see what I mean.  I've only added this for some things so far, but it basically just turns an array into xml data and writes it to an xml file in the tmp directory.


VIEW

- option to use alias or displayname as the name shown in the interface 
- tactical overview - additional data about monitoring performance??
- tactical overview - filter for flapping, notification, event handlers, active checks, passive checks 
- add links for xml viewing where applicable
- create filters for hostgroups->state_types and servicegroup->state_types
- create nagios.cmd API for submitting commands without Core interface
